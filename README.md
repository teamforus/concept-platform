# Forus

## What is forus?

Forus is a platform for the conditional exchange of value. The platform knows four generic actors. Each actor has his own web environment.

A **sponsor** who makes resources available under certain criteria. 
A **requester** who applies for the resources. A **validator** that signs criteria of requesters. A **provider** who delivers the product or service, and receives payment from the sponsor.

## Forus as a software product

The software product exists out of frontend webshops, dashboards called Platform Forus and two native apps called Me. The dashboards and apps are generic. The webshops have implementations that are styled for specific clients of Forus.

### Example case of an implementation of Forus
An example of an implementation in which all of these roles would interact, could look like an e-commerce platform for governmental services.

A citizen (requester) could apply for special health-related assistance pledged by a municipality (sponsor), if he/she is entitled to it according to certain criteria arising from predetermined policy.

To check if the citizen meets these criteria a doctor (validator) can be chosen by the municipality to validate the condition of the citizen.

The actual assistance is provided in hospital (provider).
